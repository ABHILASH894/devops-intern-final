# Loki Setup Instructions

## 1. How I Started Loki

I pulled and ran the official Grafana Loki Docker image:

docker pull grafana/loki:latest

Then started Loki locally on port 3100:

docker run -d --name=loki -p 3100:3100 grafana/loki:latest

To verify Loki was running, I checked its readiness endpoint:

curl http://18.191.51.164:3100/ready
# Response: ready

## 2. Log Forwarding Setup
I forwarded logs from my Nomad deployed container using a manual curl push:

curl -X POST http://18.191.51.164:3100/api/prom/push \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "streams": [
      {
        "stream": {
          "job": "hello-devops"
        },
        "values": [
          [ "'$(date +%s%N)'", "'"$(docker logs <container-id> 2>&1 | tail -n 1)"'" ]
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'

Replace `<container-id>` with the actual container ID of your from `docker ps`.

## 3. Viewing Logs
Logs were pushed to Loki and can be viewed by integrating with Grafana or querying Lokiâ€™s API.
